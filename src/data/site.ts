Desperate and alone, she seeks refuge with the most powerful Alpha in Elyndor, Kaidon — unaware that he is her fated mate. But Kaidon is no ordinary Alpha, and Serena's quest for revenge is only the beginning. As dark forces rise and secrets unravel, she's thrust into a battle far greater than anything she ever imagined. Will her unrelenting thirst for revenge consume her, or can she uncover the truth and embrace a destiny that could change the fate of Elyndor forever?",

The day I caught my Alpha buried between her thighs — his fangs marking her where mine should've been. When I uncovered a secret that could destroy him, they shot me dead. But death didn't stick. The Moon Goddess sent me back — dripping with fury and vengeance — to the day he proposed. This time? I'll play the perfect Luna. While he's lost in the heat of my body, I'll smile — because his empire is already crumbling in my hands. And there's the rival Alpha who's always watched me with dark, possessive eyes. Help me break him, and I'll let you do much more. Revenge so sweet, it's filthy.",

But one choice shatters everything, leaving her broken and more alone than ever. Then there's Rafael. Dark. Untouchable. The boy everyone talks about but no one really knows. He should be the last person Vivienne gets close to, yet she can't look away. He pulls her in with a kind of danger that feels both terrifying and safe — like he sees the parts of her no one else can. But Rafael carries secrets that could destroy them both. And the closer Vivienne gets, the harder it is to tell if he's her way out… or the reason she never escapes.",

Rejected at the mating ball and left to freeze in the snow by her own father, she's saved by the last person she expected — Draven Stormclaw, the notorious bastard son everyone fears. His price for her rescue? Marriage. He claims he wants the scandal. But the way he looks at her — the careful touches, the fierce protection, the warmth hidden beneath his cold reputation — tells a different story. With her eighteenth birthday approaching — the day she'll finally sense her true mate — time is running out for secrets. Because some bonds are written in the stars. And some are forged in snow and desperation.",

When she's offered as a sacrifice to the feared Feral Lycan King, everyone expects her to die like the others. But she doesn't. Against all odds, she survives his claim — and awakens something dangerous inside him. Something he refuses to let go. Now trapped in his dark world of power and madness, Tessa must fight to endure the beast who owns her… even as forbidden desire begins to burn between them. Yet shadows stir beyond the castle walls. Enemies whisper of war. And the greatest threat may not be the king who claimed her, but the secret buried deep within her soul.",
